Yo, they must wanna fry They can't touch the knowledge I personify I travel through the darkness, carrying my torch The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort You know my steez Let em know, do your thing, God Keep it live  You know my steez Let em know, do your thing, God Keep it live  You know my steez Let em know, do your thing, God Keep it live  You know my steez Let em know, do your thing, God Keep it live  The mic On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet Trying to be fly, riding high on the jet-set With juvenile rhymes, making fake-ass death threats Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel Styles more tangible, and image more real For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts When it's time to go all out you be like, \"Damn, he flipped!\" Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one Known as Bald Head Slick  why is the press all on my di-dick? My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a frigging riot Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond The mic's either a magic wand Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone And if you thought we'd lose our niche In this rap shit, you way wrong I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon Your song's pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on Word is bond You know my steez"

And runnin' from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, Mama You always was a black queen, Mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya?  Sweet lady, place no one above ya  Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone I hung around with the thugs And even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin' I needed money of my own, so I started slangin' I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox I love payin' rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you ‘Cause when I was low you was there for me You never left me alone, because you cared for me And I could see you comin' home after work late You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate You just workin' with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin' But now the road got rough, you're alone You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya?  Sweet lady, place no one above ya  Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? Pour out some liquor and I reminisce ‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya?

Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel My poetry's deep, I never fell Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing  No doubt Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel My poetry's deep, I never fell Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing No doubt   Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money Corporate accounts from a rich company I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam Bulletproof Hummer man I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in your system every night, now Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel My poetry's deep, I never fell Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing No doubt Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel My poetry's deep, I never fell Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing No doubt ; Nas is like"

Ho, please! You better bow down on both knees Who you think taught you to smoke trees? Who you think brought you the oldies? Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s The Snoop D-O-double-G's And the group that said, \"Motherfuck the police!\" Gave you a tape full of dope beats To bump when you stroll through in your hood And when your album sales weren't doin' too good Who's the Doctor they told you to go see? Y'all better listen up closely All you niggas that said that I turned pop Or The Firm flopped Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep So fuck y'all, all of y'all!

Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?  Just study a tape of N.W.A One day I was walkin' by With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy Gave me an awkward eye  And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge When I'm drunk as fuck Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage Hoppin' out with two broken legs Tryna walk it off Fuck you too, bitch!

I told 'em all All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all? Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none What, you think I sold 'em all ‘Cause I stay well off? Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off What, ‘cause I been in the lab With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off? I ain't havin' that This is the millennium of Aftermath It ain't gon' be nothin' after that So give me one more platinum plaque And fuck rap, you can have it back So where's all the Mad Rappers at? It's like a jungle in this habitat But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre"

The crowd couldn’t wait to see this Nobody been this long-awaited since Jesus Who wouldn’t believe this?  I heard the word on the street is I’m still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas. They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of So I made some more to put the New World in Order With mathematics, put your status above the average And help you rappers make paragraphs with graphics ‘Cause new days is dawning, new ways of performing Brainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning On and on, and I got the whole world responding Rock, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warning The emperor well-known for inventing a sentence Full of adventure, turning up the temperature Rush with adrenaline.

I broke the Code of silence with overloads of talents My only challenge is not to explode in violence I’m Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit—at least Once during the course of a day—it’s automatic In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian pharaoh Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow Allah’s monotony—so far, they can’t stop me.  You know Ra want property like Muammar Gaddafi More thoughts than Bibles, recitals taught disciples A sawed-off mic, so words scatter like a rifle Thoughts that’s trifle, I’m busting these for you.

They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic Critics and biters don’t know where my source of light is Still leave authors and writers with arthritis Cursed kids like the pyramids when they found the style First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile The rebirth of hip-hop’ll be dropped now ‘cause the crowd Didn’t hear the original in a while So be alarmed.  What you ‘bout to see is the bomb like 3D in ‘Nam, vivid like CD-Rom Info kept like internet.com, my note- -book’s my bond like the Holy Quran since I came in the door—said it before But, no, I ain’t down with Eric B. no more.  At night The open mic be inviting me to rhyme So, yo, I’m online.

What's your name love, where you came from? Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
