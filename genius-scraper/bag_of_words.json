Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin' In my lonely luxury I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night? Why do we sleep where we want to hide? Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? Why am I a sucker for all your lies? Strung out like laundry on every line Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking So, tell me pretty lies, look me in my face Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake You can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin' I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night? Why do we sleep where we want to hide? Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? Why am I a sucker for all your lies? Strung out like laundry on every line Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? Thinkin' about you, you're in my head Even without you, I still feel dead Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head Even without you, I still feel dead Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? I'm wondering why do all the monsters come out at night? Why do we sleep where we want to hide?  Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? Why am I a sucker for all your lies? Strung out like laundry on every line Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?  Like I don't mind if you fuck up my life"

In pockets made of thoughts That I had bought when I was travelling We're beautiful All of us together Joy and love forever This perfect life Love and joy together You and me forever We're beautiful All of us together Joy and love forever This perfect life Love and joy together You and me forever"

Any here? Any there? Any motions anywhere? Going twice, going thrice Guess this means we'll go four times a lady I promise I'll be all you'll need, ever need You'll never have to shop around  And I'll give you all you'll ever need, ever need Don't worry, I will never let you down, let you down Don't worry, I will never let you down So many ladies are wanting for mates And the prospects are good, but the date's never great Over here, over there, over where?

Do you really wanna be another trend? Do you wanna be part of that crowd? 'Cause I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be You, don't wanna be just like you Uh, what I'm saying is This is the anthem, throw all your hands up You, don't wanna be you Shake it once, that's fine, shake it twice, that's okay Shake it three times, you're playing with your self again  What I'm saying is This is the anthem, throw all your hands up Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me You, don't wanna be just like you  This is the anthem, throw all your hands up Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me Another loser anthem  Another loser anthem  Another loser anthem  Another loser anthem"

I'll never be the same Not two days ago, I was having a look In a book and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees I said, \"I can relate,\" because lately I've been Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from The burdens of the planet earth Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D But thinking so much differently So pardon me while I burst into flames I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame Pardon me, pardon me... I'll never be the same Never be the same, yeah Pardon me while I burst into flames Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me So pardon me while I burst into flames I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame Pardon me, pardon me...
