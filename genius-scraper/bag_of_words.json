Why do we sleep where we want to hide? Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? Why am I a sucker for all your lies? Strung out like laundry on every line Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking So, tell me pretty lies, look me in my face Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake You can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin' I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night? Why do we sleep where we want to hide? Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? Why am I a sucker for all your lies? Strung out like laundry on every line Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? Thinkin' about you, you're in my head Even without you, I still feel dead Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head Even without you, I still feel dead Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? I'm wondering why do all the monsters come out at night? Why do we sleep where we want to hide?  Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? Why am I a sucker for all your lies? Strung out like laundry on every line Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?  Like I don't mind if you fuck up my life"

In pockets made of thoughts That I had bought when I was travelling We're beautiful All of us together Joy and love forever This perfect life Love and joy together You and me forever We're beautiful All of us together Joy and love forever This perfect life Love and joy together You and me forever"

Any here? Any there? Any motions anywhere? Going twice, going thrice Guess this means we'll go four times a lady I promise I'll be all you'll need, ever need You'll never have to shop around  And I'll give you all you'll ever need, ever need Don't worry, I will never let you down, let you down Don't worry, I will never let you down So many ladies are wanting for mates And the prospects are good, but the date's never great Over here, over there, over where?

'Cause I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be You, don't wanna be just like you Uh, what I'm saying is This is the anthem, throw all your hands up You, don't wanna be you Shake it once, that's fine, shake it twice, that's okay Shake it three times, you're playing with your self again  What I'm saying is This is the anthem, throw all your hands up Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me You, don't wanna be just like you  This is the anthem, throw all your hands up Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me Another loser anthem  Another loser anthem  Another loser anthem  Another loser anthem"

I'll never be the same Never be the same, yeah Pardon me while I burst into flames Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me So pardon me while I burst into flames I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame Pardon me, pardon me...

I, I guess right now we should start the show Who's the suspicious character Strapped with the sounds profound Similar to rounds spit by Derringers You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads ‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties While real MC's and DJ's are a minority But right about now, I use my authority ‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy The horror be when I return for my real people Words that split wigs hitting like some double Desert Eagles Sporting caps pulled low, and baggy slacks Subtracting all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse So as I have in the past, I whoop ass Dropping lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that While the world's revolving, on its axis I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics The wilderness is filled with this So many people searching for false bliss I'm here with the skills you've missed The rejected stone is now the cornerstone Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home You know my steez You know my steez Let 'em know, do your thing, God Keep it live  To the beat y'all The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax I'm like the minister, when I be lacing the wax I be bringing salvation through the way that I rap And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power When the mic's within my reach, I'm feeling more power Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour It's often easier for one to give advice Than it is for a person to run one's own life That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight The apparatus gets blessed And suckers get put to rest No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess The wackness is spreading like the plague MC's lucked up and got paid But still can't make the fucking grade How many times are wannabe's gonna lie? Yo, they must wanna fry They can't touch the knowledge I personify I travel through the darkness, carrying my torch The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort You know my steez Let em know, do your thing, God Keep it live  You know my steez Let em know, do your thing, God Keep it live  You know my steez Let em know, do your thing, God Keep it live  You know my steez Let em know, do your thing, God Keep it live  The mic On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet Trying to be fly, riding high on the jet-set With juvenile rhymes, making fake-ass death threats Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel Styles more tangible, and image more real For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts When it's time to go all out you be like, \"Damn, he flipped!\" Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one Known as Bald Head Slick  why is the press all on my di-dick? My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a frigging riot Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond The mic's either a magic wand Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone And if you thought we'd lose our niche In this rap shit, you way wrong I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon Your song's pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on Word is bond You know my steez"

When brothers make babies And leave a young mother to be a pappy And since we all came from a woman Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman I wonder why we take from our women Why we rape our women — do we hate our women? I think it's time to kill for our women Time to heal our women, be real to our women And if we don't we'll have a race of babies That will hate the ladies that make the babies And since a man can't make one He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one So will the real men get up? I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough And though we had it rough, we always had enough I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two And I realize Mama really paid the price She nearly gave her life to raise me right And all I had to give her was my pipe dream Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind Last night my buddy lost his whole family It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity It seems the rain'll never let up I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours They got money for wars but can't feed the poor Say there ain't no hope for the youth And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future And then they wonder why we crazy I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em ‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more ‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo' You can't complain you was dealt this Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless Because there's too many things for you to deal with Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless While tears is rollin' down your cheeks You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week ‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it And now my son's gettin' older and older And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders While the rich kids is drivin' Benz I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up But please, you got to keep ya head up"

And runnin' from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, Mama You always was a black queen, Mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya?

Sweet lady, place no one above ya  Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? Pour out some liquor and I reminisce ‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya?

Now don't be wishin' of switchin' any positions with me Cause when you in my position, it ain't never easy To do any type of maintainin' Cause all this gamin' and famin' from entertainin' Is hella strainin'  But I can't keep runnin' I just gotta keep keen and cunnin' Can't keep running away Can't keep running away Can't keep running away Can't keep running away"

I heard the word on the street is I’m still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas. They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of So I made some more to put the New World in Order With mathematics, put your status above the average And help you rappers make paragraphs with graphics ‘Cause new days is dawning, new ways of performing Brainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning On and on, and I got the whole world responding Rock, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warning The emperor well-known for inventing a sentence Full of adventure, turning up the temperature Rush with adrenaline.  How long has it been again To be in the state of mind that Rakim is in? “It’s been a long time” “Rakim… the microphone soloist” “It’s been a long time”  “Rakim” When I’m out propping, either hanging or shopping People see me, stop and ask me when the album dropping The wait is over.  In formation like a soldier, like I Told ya: greater, stronger, now that I’m older. I broke the Code of silence with overloads of talents My only challenge is not to explode in violence I’m Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit—at least Once during the course of a day—it’s automatic In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian pharaoh Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow Allah’s monotony—so far, they can’t stop me.  You know Ra want property like Muammar Gaddafi More thoughts than Bibles, recitals taught disciples A sawed-off mic, so words scatter like a rifle Thoughts that’s trifle, I’m busting these for you.  Ayyo Technical difficulties is through “It’s been a long time” “Rakim… the microphone soloist” “It’s been a long time” “Rakim… the microphone soloist” “It’s been a long time” “Rakim… the microphone soloist” “It’s been a long time”  When I float At night, I show ‘em new heights I go to write.  They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic Critics and biters don’t know where my source of light is Still leave authors and writers with arthritis Cursed kids like the pyramids when they found the style First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile The rebirth of hip-hop’ll be dropped now ‘cause the crowd Didn’t hear the original in a while So be alarmed.  What you ‘bout to see is the bomb like 3D in ‘Nam, vivid like CD-Rom Info kept like internet.com, my note- -book’s my bond like the Holy Quran since I came in the door—said it before But, no, I ain’t down with Eric B. no more.  At night The open mic be inviting me to rhyme So, yo, I’m online.  It’s been a long time “It’s been a long time”  “Rakim… the microphone soloist” “It’s been a long time” “Rakim… the microphone soloist” “It’s been a long time”"

Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her Wired her a letter to get her, and it went My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you When I try or make some sort of attempt, I symp Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp Cause then I would let you know that I love you so And if I was your man then I would be true The only lying I would do is in the bed with you Then I signed sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by She keeps on pa-- Passing me by She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by"
